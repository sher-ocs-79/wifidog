RADIUS AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT SECTION
=====================================

The following section only needs to be followed if you want RADIUS support.

You'll need to install PEAR and several PEAR and PHP modules.  The procedure
below is for PHP 5.0.2 under Mandrake 10.1. You WILL need to adapt it under
other distributions.

All necessary RPM packages are available in the contrib urpmi source. If you
don't have a contrib source already, you can add one with the command:

urpmi.addmedia contrib http://gulus.usherbrooke.ca/pub/distro/Mandrakelinux/official/10.1/i586/media/contrib with media_info/hdlist.cz

You'll need the following packages:
libphp5-commons
php5-cli
php5-devel
php5-xml
php5-xmlrpc ---> depends on libxmlrpc
php5-mhash
php5-mcrypt

The following command should install them all and resolve dependencies:

urpmi php5-cli php5-devel php5-xml php5-xmlrpc php5-mhash php5-mcrypt

To install PEAR, run this in a shell:
"lynx -source http://go-pear.org | php5"

WARNING:
--------
You must have PHP5 CLI with php5ize installed

NB: By default Mandrake renames the PHP binaries with a 5 suffix. You should
    create symbolic links so that you can use standard scripts:

    ln -s /usr/bin/php5 /usr/bin/php
    ln -s /usr/bin/php5ize /usr/bin/phpize

Now you'll need a few packages, you can let PEAR install them automatically:

pear install radius Auth_RADIUS Crypt_CHAP
